# Football Prediction App - CORS and SportMonks Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve CORS issues, enable upcoming matches display, and add squad data functionality to the football prediction app.

## Changes Made

### 1. CORS Configuration Fixes

#### Backend (app.py)
- Enhanced CORS configuration with explicit settings
- Added `expose_headers` and `max_age` for better preflight handling
- Configuration now includes:
  ```python
  CORS(app, 
       origins=app.config['CORS_ORIGINS'],
       allow_headers=['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'X-API-Key'],
       methods=['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
       supports_credentials=True,
       expose_headers=['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
       max_age=3600)  # Cache preflight requests for 1 hour
  ```

#### Security Headers (security.py)
- Updated `add_security_headers` function to avoid overriding CORS headers
- Added check to only set CORS headers if not already set by Flask-CORS
- Includes proper handling for frontend domains

### 2. SportMonks API Endpoints

#### Mock Data Support
Added mock data functionality to all SportMonks endpoints to ensure the app works even without API keys configured:

1. **Upcoming Fixtures** (`/api/sportmonks/fixtures/upcoming`)
   - Returns mock Premier League fixtures when no API key is configured
   - Includes predictions data
   - Proper error handling with fallback to empty data

2. **Leagues** (`/api/sportmonks/leagues`)
   - Returns mock leagues (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, etc.)
   - Supports country filtering

3. **Teams by League** (`/api/sportmonks/leagues/<league_id>/teams`)
   - Returns mock teams for Premier League and Serie A
   - Includes team details like logo, founded year, etc.

4. **Team Details with Squad** (`/api/sportmonks/teams/<team_id>`)
   - Returns detailed team information including squad
   - Mock data includes players with positions, numbers, nationality

### 3. New Features

#### Squad Data Implementation
- Created new React component: `SquadView.tsx`
- Displays teams by league with search functionality
- Shows squad details in a modal with players grouped by position
- Responsive design with proper styling

#### Frontend Components
1. **SquadView Component** (`frontend/src/components/SquadView.tsx`)
   - League selection dropdown
   - Team search functionality
   - Grid display of teams
   - Modal for squad details

2. **SquadView Styles** (`frontend/src/components/SquadView.css`)
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Card-based layout for teams
   - Clean modal presentation for squad data

3. **SportMonks Page Update**
   - Added new "Team Squads" tab
   - Integrated with existing navigation

### 4. API Client Updates

#### SportMonks Client (`sportmonks_client.py`)
- Added `get_teams_by_league` method
- Proper error handling for missing API keys

### 5. Debug Endpoints
Added debug endpoint for troubleshooting:
- `/api/sportmonks/debug/config` - Shows API configuration status

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment

1. **Commit and push all changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix CORS issues, add mock data support, and implement squad functionality"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Environment Variables to Set in Render Dashboard:**
   - `SPORTMONKS_API_KEY` - Your SportMonks API key (optional)
   - `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` - Strong password for token encryption
   - `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_SALT` - Unique salt for token encryption
   - `CORS_ORIGINS` - Already configured in render.yaml

3. **Verify Backend Deployment:**
   - Check Render dashboard for successful deployment
   - Test endpoints:
     - https://football-prediction-backend-2cvi.onrender.com/api/sportmonks/health
     - https://football-prediction-backend-2cvi.onrender.com/api/sportmonks/fixtures/upcoming?days=7&predictions=true

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend should automatically deploy when changes are pushed. No additional configuration needed as the API URL is already set correctly in the render.yaml.

## Testing

### Test CORS is Working:
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://football-prediction-frontend-zx5z.onrender.com" \
     -I https://football-prediction-backend-2cvi.onrender.com/api/sportmonks/health
```

### Test Endpoints:
1. **Upcoming Fixtures:** Visit the AI Predictions tab in SportMonks section
2. **Squad Data:** Visit the Team Squads tab in SportMonks section

## Important Notes

1. **Mock Data**: The app will work without SportMonks API keys by using mock data
2. **API Keys**: To use real data, set the `SPORTMONKS_API_KEY` environment variable in Render
3. **CORS**: The frontend domain is properly configured in both config.py and render.yaml
4. **Error Handling**: All endpoints return 200 status with error messages to avoid CORS preflight issues

## Summary of Files Modified

### Backend:
- `/football-prediction-app/backend/app.py`
- `/football-prediction-app/backend/security.py`
- `/football-prediction-app/backend/sportmonks_routes.py`
- `/football-prediction-app/backend/sportmonks_client.py`

### Frontend:
- `/football-prediction-app/frontend/src/components/SquadView.tsx` (new)
- `/football-prediction-app/frontend/src/components/SquadView.css` (new)
- `/football-prediction-app/frontend/src/pages/SportMonks.tsx`

### Configuration:
- `/render.yaml` (already properly configured)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check CORS headers**: Use browser developer tools to inspect response headers
2. **Check API configuration**: Use the debug endpoint to verify configuration
3. **Check Render logs**: Look for any deployment or runtime errors
4. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in Render

The app should now be fully functional with:
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Upcoming matches displaying (with mock data if no API key)
- ✅ Squad data functionality implemented
- ✅ Error handling for missing API keys
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
