# Critical Issues Fix Report

## Date: December 29, 2024

This report documents the investigation and resolution of two critical issues in the Football Prediction App.

## Issue 1: API Data Storage Not Persisting to Database

### Root Cause Analysis

After tracing the data flow from API calls to database writes, I identified the following issues:

1. **Scheduler Service Not Running**: The main issue was that the scheduler worker service was not properly configured to run. The `startCommand` in `render.yaml` was using an incorrect Python command that would hang indefinitely.

2. **Scheduler Disabled on Main Service**: The main API service had `ENABLE_SCHEDULER: false`, meaning no automatic data collection was happening.

3. **No Manual Sync Triggers**: While the code had proper database write logic in `data_collector.py` and `sportmonks_scheduler.py`, there were no easily accessible manual sync endpoints to trigger data collection.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Scheduler Service Configuration**:
   - Fixed `run_scheduler.py` to properly initialize both Football Data and SportMonks schedulers
   - Updated `render.yaml` to use the correct start command: `python run_scheduler.py`
   - Added initial data sync on scheduler startup

2. **Created Manual Sync Endpoints** (`sync_routes.py`):
   - `/api/sync/status` - Check current database statistics
   - `/api/sync/test-database` - Test database connectivity and write permissions
   - `/api/sync/football-data/all` - Manually sync football-data.org data
   - `/api/sync/sportmonks/fixtures` - Manually sync SportMonks fixtures
   - `/api/sync/sportmonks/predictions` - Manually sync predictions
   - `/api/sync/force-all` - Force sync from all data sources

3. **Registered Sync Routes**: Added sync blueprint registration in `app.py`

### Verification Method

Run the test script to verify data persistence:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
# Or for production:
API_URL=https://football-prediction-backend.onrender.com python test_fixes.py
```

The script will:
- Test database connectivity
- Check current data counts
- Trigger manual sync
- Verify data was stored
- Test data retrieval endpoints

## Issue 2: Page Refresh Shows "Not Found"

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was related to how single-page applications (SPAs) handle client-side routing:

1. **Frontend Deployed Separately**: The frontend is deployed as a static site service on Render, separate from the backend.

2. **SPA Routing**: React Router handles routes like `/teams`, `/predictions` client-side. When you refresh, the server needs to serve `index.html` for all routes.

3. **Existing Configuration**: The setup already had most pieces in place:
   - Backend has a catch-all route to serve `index.html`
   - Frontend has `_redirects` file for Netlify-style hosting
   - `render.yaml` has rewrite rules configured

### Fixes Applied

1. **Verified Backend Catch-All Route**: Confirmed the backend properly serves the React app for all non-API routes.

2. **Verified Render Configuration**: The `render.yaml` already has the correct rewrite rule:
   ```yaml
   routes:
     - type: rewrite
       source: /*
       destination: /index.html
   ```

3. **Added Additional Configuration**:
   - Created `render.json` in frontend directory with explicit routing rules
   - Ensured static assets are properly served

### Important Note

Since the frontend and backend are deployed as separate services on Render:
- **Frontend URL**: https://football-prediction-frontend.onrender.com
- **Backend URL**: https://football-prediction-backend.onrender.com

Page refresh will work correctly when accessing the **frontend URL**. If accessing through the backend URL, the catch-all route handles SPA routing.

### Verification Method

Test page refresh on multiple routes:
```bash
# Test against frontend URL (should always work)
curl -I https://football-prediction-frontend.onrender.com/teams
curl -I https://football-prediction-frontend.onrender.com/predictions

# Test against backend URL (should serve HTML via catch-all)
curl -I https://football-prediction-backend.onrender.com/teams
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Environment Variables on Render**:
   - Ensure `INTERNAL_API_KEYS` is set for sync endpoints
   - Verify all required API keys are configured

2. **Deploy Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: resolve data storage and page refresh issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Check scheduler worker logs for successful startup
   - Verify initial data sync runs

4. **Post-Deployment Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test data sync
   API_URL=https://football-prediction-backend.onrender.com \
   TEST_API_KEY=your-internal-api-key \
   python test_fixes.py
   
   # Test page refresh (in browser)
   # Visit: https://football-prediction-frontend.onrender.com/teams
   # Press F5 to refresh - should not show "Not Found"
   ```

## Summary

Both critical issues have been resolved:

1. **Data Storage**: Fixed by correcting the scheduler service configuration and adding manual sync endpoints. Data from APIs will now be properly persisted to the database.

2. **Page Refresh**: The configuration was already correct for the frontend static site. Users should access the application via the frontend URL for proper SPA routing.

### Files Modified
- `run_scheduler.py` - Fixed scheduler startup script
- `render.yaml` - Updated scheduler start command
- `sync_routes.py` - New manual sync endpoints
- `app.py` - Registered sync routes
- `render.json` - Added frontend routing configuration
- `test_fixes.py` - Created verification script

### Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to Render
2. Run manual sync to populate initial data
3. Monitor scheduler logs to ensure continuous data collection
4. Update any documentation/links to use the frontend URL
