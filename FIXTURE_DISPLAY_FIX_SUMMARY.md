# Fixture Display Fix Summary

## Date: August 15, 2025

## Issue Description
EPL matches scheduled for today (August 15, 2025) and tomorrow were not appearing in the frontend. Past fixtures were also missing. This was due to date filtering logic that excluded current-day matches.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (sportmonks_routes.py)

1. **Fixed `get_upcoming_fixtures` endpoint**
   - Changed start date from current time to beginning of today (00:00:00 UTC)
   - This ensures today's matches are included in upcoming fixtures
   ```python
   # Before: start_date = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
   # After: 
   today = datetime.utcnow().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
   start_date = today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
   ```

2. **Added new `/fixtures/past` endpoint**
   - Fetches fixtures from the last N days (default: 7)
   - Includes match scores and final status
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/sportmonks/fixtures/past?days=7&league_id=8`

3. **Added new `/fixtures/all` endpoint**
   - Fetches all fixtures and categorizes them as past/today/upcoming
   - Single API call for comprehensive fixture data
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/sportmonks/fixtures/all?days_back=7&days_ahead=7&league_id=8`
   - Returns structured response:
   ```json
   {
     "fixtures": {
       "past": [...],
       "today": [...],
       "upcoming": [...]
     },
     "count": {
       "past": 10,
       "today": 3,
       "upcoming": 15,
       "total": 28
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated PredictionsView Component**
   - Added tab navigation for Past/Today/Upcoming fixtures
   - Fixed EPL league ID from 2 to 8
   - Added score display for past fixtures
   - Handles fixtures without predictions gracefully
   - Updated to use the new `/fixtures/all` endpoint

2. **Added FixturesList Component**
   - New component for simplified fixture display
   - Shows all EPL fixtures in a compact format
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Displays scores for past matches

3. **CSS Updates**
   - Added styles for tab navigation
   - Added styles for score display
   - Improved responsive design
   - Added hover effects and transitions

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Purpose | Parameters |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `/api/sportmonks/fixtures/upcoming` | Get upcoming fixtures (including today) | `days`, `league_id`, `predictions` |

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify endpoints:
- `test_fixtures_endpoints.py` - Python test script
- `test_fixtures_endpoints.sh` - Bash test script using curl

## Deployment

1. Changes committed to Git with detailed commit message
2. Pushed to main branch to trigger Render auto-deployment
3. Both backend and frontend will be automatically deployed

## Expected Results

After deployment completes (5-10 minutes):

1. **Past Fixtures**: Will show matches from the last 7 days with final scores
2. **Today's Fixtures**: Will show all matches scheduled for today (August 15, 2025)
3. **Upcoming Fixtures**: Will show matches for the next 7 days including tomorrow
