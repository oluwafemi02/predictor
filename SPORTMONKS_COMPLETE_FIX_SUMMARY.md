# SportMonks API Integration - Complete Fix Summary

## Date: August 15, 2025

## Overview
Successfully integrated SportMonks API v3 for fixtures and odds display in the football prediction app.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixture Display Issues
- **Problem**: No EPL matches were appearing, including today's match (Liverpool vs AFC Bournemouth)
- **Root Cause**: Using wrong API endpoint `/fixtures` with date filters
- **Solution**: Implemented `/schedules/seasons/{season_id}/teams/{team_id}` endpoint

### 2. Odds Integration
- **Problem**: Odds component needed proper API integration
- **Root Cause**: API structure changed in v3
- **Solution**: Implemented `/rounds/{round_id}` endpoint with embedded odds data

## Changes Implemented

### Backend Updates

#### 1. SportMonks Client (`sportmonks_client.py`)
Added new methods:
- `get_season_schedule()` - Fetches fixtures from season schedules
- `get_current_season_id()` - Gets current season ID for a league
- `get_round_with_odds()` - Fetches round fixtures with embedded odds
- `get_current_round()` - Gets current round ID for a league
- `get_fixture_with_odds()` - Fetches single fixture with odds

#### 2. Routes (`sportmonks_routes.py`)
- Updated `/fixtures/all` to use season schedules API
- Modified `/fixtures/upcoming` to include today's matches
- Enhanced `/odds/<fixture_id>` to use embedded odds structure
- Added `/fixtures/round/{round_id}/odds` for bulk odds fetching

### Frontend Updates

#### 1. PredictionsView Component
- Added tabs for Past/Today/Upcoming fixtures
- Fixed TypeScript interfaces for optional predictions
- Added score display for completed matches
- Corrected EPL league ID from 2 to 8

#### 2. New Components
